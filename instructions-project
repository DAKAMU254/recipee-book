3. Personal Recipe Book - The personal recipe book should display all the recipes that the user has saved. The user should be able to view, edit, and delete their saved recipes.

4. Testing with Jest - Use Jest to write unit tests for your JavaScript code.

5. Responsive Design - The application should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. Styling - Use CSS to style the application and make it visually appealing.

7. Accessibility - Ensure that the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Bonus Features:

1. User Authentication - Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up and log in to their personal recipe book.

2. Recipe Sharing - Allow users to share recipes on social media platforms.

3. Recipe Categories - Categorize recipes by type of cuisine or meal.

4. Recipe Rating - Allow users to rate recipes and display the average rating for each recipe.

5. Shopping List - Allow users to create a shopping list for the ingredients they need to buy for their saved recipes.

By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional web application that demonstrates your skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jest testing.
Sider Fusion
This Recipe Book App is a fantastic project that covers a variety of key web development skills. Here’s a structured approach to help you get started on building the application, along with suggestions for implementation and technologies that you might consider using.

Project Structure
1. Technology Stack:
Frontend:
HTML/CSS for the structure and styling.
JavaScript (with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular for a more dynamic UI).
Backend (optional):
Node.js with Express.js or a serverless solution (like Firebase Functions).
Database:

Jest for unit testing JavaScript functionality.
2. Project Design:
Home Page:

Create an HTML structure for the search bar and a section for popular recipes.
Implement CSS for styling the layout.
JavaScript to handle fetching and displaying recipes based on user input or popular categories.
Recipe Page:

Use a dynamic route to display individual recipe details.
Include sections for ingredients and instructions along with a save button.
Personal Recipe Book:
